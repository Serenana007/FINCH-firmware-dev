# Firmware Testing and Development

This is the main repo for the development of component drivers, software, and other integrations with the MCUs. Final firmware is committed to the [firmware-core](https://github.com/spacesys-finch/firmware-core) repo.

The `main` branch is used to store templates for each of the devkits (currently the [NUCLEO-H743ZI2](NUCLEO-H743ZI2-template/) and the [NUCLEO-G431RB](NUCLEO-G431RB-template/)), and then development is done in individual branches. This helps manage the size of the cloned repo on local machines.
